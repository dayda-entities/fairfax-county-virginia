</font><font color='#000000' face='Times New Roman' size='3'>The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Ordinance was adopted to
protect our local streams and one of the world's most productive estuaries, the
Chesapeake Bay, from pollution due to land use and development. All of Fairfax
County drains into the Potomac River and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay. In an
effort to protect and improve the quality of these waterways, sensitive areas
along streams throughout Fairfax County have been designated as Resource
Protection Areas.</font></p><p style='margin: 0in 0in 0pt;'><font color='#000000' face='Times New Roman' size='3'>State regulations require that Resource Protection Areas
(RPAs) be designated around all water bodies with perennial flow. Perennial
flow means that water always flows in the stream or other water body except
during periods of drought. The Department of Public Works and Environmental
Services conducted field studies to identify all perennial streams throughout
the county and used this information to prepare a set of maps showing the
location of RPAs as defined under the revised Ordinance. The maps were adopted
by the Board on November 17, 2003. </font></p><p style='margin: 0in 0in 0pt;'><font color='#000000' face='Times New Roman' size='3'></font></p><p style='margin: 0in 0in 0pt;'><font color='#000000' face='Times New Roman' size='3'>The data include the boundaries of the RPAs adopted by the
Board in 1993 and the additional RPAs adopted by the Board in 2003. These are general locations of RPA boundaries for planning purposes and the
actual limits may be further refined by detailed field studies conducted at the
time a plan is submitted to obtain a permit to develop a property.</font></p><p style='margin: 0in 0in 0pt;'><font color='#000000' face='Times New Roman' size='3'></font></p><p style='margin: 0in 0in 0pt;'><font color='#000000' face='Times New Roman' size='3'>Any areas within Fairfax County not contained within the
RPAs are Resource Management Areas (RMAs). Together, the RPAs and RMAs comprise
the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas.</font></p>
