<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>This layer contains cadastral information for Fairfax County, Virginia. This includes, but is not limited to the portrayal of polygonal features (such as parcels, subdivisions and easements), text (parcel numbers, street names and addresses), and symbols (parkland, schools, "double circles", etc.). This layer was initially developed as a digital copy of the ink-on-mylar property maps maintained by the County since the early 1960's.</span></p></div></div></div>
