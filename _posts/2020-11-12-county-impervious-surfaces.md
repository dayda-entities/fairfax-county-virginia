This layer was created by combining the following 2009 planimetric features into a single, countywide layer: Major transportation, minor transportation, sidewalk centerlines buffered based on width attribute, buildings and paved recreational features such as tennis courts and basketball courts. All features were digitized or verified from 2009 aerial photography.
