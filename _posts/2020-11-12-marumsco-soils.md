Marumsco soils in Fairfax County.  Marumsco soils are mapped in complexes with other soil types.  The complexes are highly variable and consist of combinations of clays, silts, sands, and gravels.  They may also be problematic.  In steep areas that contain clays known as &quot;marine clays&quot; slope stability can be a problem.  In addition, structures constructed on clays found in this complex could suffer foundation distress if adequate precautions are not taken during design and construction.
