Historic overlay districts in Fairfax County. Historic overlay districts (HODs) are bounded areas created by the Board of Supervisors. Inside an HOD certain regulations on development apply which serve to protect historic resources inside that area. HODs are administered by the History Commission and the Planning Division of the Department of Planning and Zoning.
