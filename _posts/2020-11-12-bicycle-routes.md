<div>This contains scores developed by the Bicycle Level of Service Model for Fairfax County. Additionally this data contains attributes used to identify road suitability for the Fairfax County bicycle map.</div><div>Paved trails and quiet neighborhood streets, shown in purple and green respectively, are the most pleasant places to ride, and are fun for users of all ages and abilities. Enjoy a family ride to the park or bike to the ice cream store. Routes shown in blue are still comfortable for most adults but may not be suitable for young children due to slightly higher traffic volumes. Some of these roads have bike lanes, ridable shoulders, or shared lane markings. Have fun, relax, and enjoy the ride!<br />Use with Caution<br />People with signiﬁcant riding experience should still feel comfortable on most orange routes, where you should expect to interact with more and faster motor vehicles. These routes can be very congested during peak hours, but experience low traffic volumes at other times. Routes shown in dark gray are busy arterials, or narrow, winding country roads, and are not suitable for the average cyclist. Experienced cyclists should use these roads with caution. Some of the arterials have wide shoulders or bike lanes. Less conﬁdent riders should look for a parallel trail or green neighborhood route, ride on the sidewalk when there is no alternative available (it’s legal, but ride with traffic and use caution at driveways— drivers may not expect you), or hop on a bus to continue your trip (you can take your bike with you).<br /></div>
