US Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service. The 2011
soil survey was prepared to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and
utilized nationally recognized names for soil types. The 2018 soil map legend
is identical to the 2011 legend, but the soil boundaries have been shifted to
better correlate with topography and land use. This map was officially adopted
by the Board of Supervisors in 2018. All construction plans submitted to the
County for permits that require the inclusion of soils mapping should reference
the 2018 soils map.</span></p><p><font color='#000000' size='3'></font></p>
