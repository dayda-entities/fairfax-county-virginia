This layer was extracted from the 2015 land cover raster and converted to polygons.  The polygons represent areas of tree canopy derived from classification of Worldview-2 satellite imagery.  The layer can be used to show areas of tree canopy in maps and can serve as a basis for calculating areas of tree cover impacted by development.
