A Fairfax County police officer-involved shooting is the discharge of a firearm, at a person, or at an occupied vehicle, whether intentional or unintentional, while in the performance of their duties as a law enforcement officer. For the purposes of this posting, an officer-involved shooting will only refer to the instances in which an officer discharged a firearm at a person, or at a vehicle occupied by a person or persons, and not officer actions in animal cases. Each event is represented here as the Roadway Line Segment that represents the one hundred block that the event was reported to have occurred within.
